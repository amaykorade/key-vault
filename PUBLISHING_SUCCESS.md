- **Install**: `pip install amay-key-vault-sdk`

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### JavaScript/Node.js
```bash
npm install amay-key-vault-sdk
```

```javascript
const { KeyVault } = require('amay-key-vault-sdk');
// or
import { KeyVault } from 'amay-key-vault-sdk';

const kv = new KeyVault('your-api-token', 'your-base-url');

// New path-based access methods
const keys = await kv.getKeysByPath('MyApp/Production');
const projectKeys = await kv.getProjectKeys('MyApp');
const envKeys = await kv.getEnvironmentKeys('MyApp', 'PRODUCTION');
```

### Python
```bash
pip install amay-key-vault-sdk
```

```python
from key_vault_sdk import KeyVault

kv = KeyVault('your-api-token', 'your-base-url')

# New path-based access methods
keys = kv.get_keys_by_path('MyApp/Production')
project_keys = kv.get_project_keys('MyApp')
env_keys = kv.get_environment_keys('MyApp', 'PRODUCTION')
```

## 🔍 Verification Results

### JavaScript SDK ✅
- Successfully published to npm
- Package installs correctly
- All methods available including new path-based access
- Supports both ESM and CommonJS

### Python SDK ✅
- Successfully published to PyPI
- Package installs correctly
- All methods available including new path-based access
- Compatible with Python 3.7+

## 🆕 New Features in v1.0.4

### Path-Based Key Access
- `getKeysByPath('ProjectName/Subfolder')` - Access keys by human-readable paths
- `getProjectKeys('ProjectName')` - Get all keys in a project
- `getEnvironmentKeys('ProjectName', 'ENVIRONMENT')` - Get keys filtered by environment

### Benefits
- **Easier to use**: No need to know folder IDs
- **More intuitive**: Use project/subfolder names instead of UUIDs
- **Environment filtering**: Easy access to keys by environment (dev/staging/prod)
- **Backward compatible**: All existing methods still work
